Python Map, Filter & Reduce Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Python exercises focused on higher-order functions — map(), filter(), and reduce(). It is designed to practice functional programming techniques and data transformations in Python.

Contents

The exercises are divided into four groups:

🟢 Map-only exercises (1–15)

Exercises using map() to transform data, such as doubling numbers, converting Celsius to Fahrenheit, squaring values, and more.

🟡 Filter-only exercises (16–30)

Exercises using filter() to select elements that match certain conditions, like keeping even numbers, filtering words longer than 5 letters, or removing negative numbers.

🟠 Map + Filter exercises (31–40)

Exercises combining map() and filter() to first filter elements and then transform them, such as filtering odd numbers and cubing them or selecting short words and converting to uppercase.

🔴 Map + Filter + Reduce exercises (41–50)

Advanced exercises using map(), filter(), and reduce() together to filter, transform, and aggregate data, such as summing transformed numbers or calculating totals after applying transformations.
